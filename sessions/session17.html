		<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>While we have the rest of the day to do what we need to do to prepare for our trip to Deastock, we decide to explore <a class="bookmark" href="#zadash">Zadash</a> 
				and see what all it has to offer. </p>
			<p>As we are walking around exploring, we noticed a crownsguardsman following us from a distance. It was odd because he was by himself, where most crownsguardman were 
				walking in pairs and groups. Hee was wanting some more diamonds to have the ability to revive ourselves, or the unfortunate individuals we accidentally kill, so 
				we went searching for jewelry stores. A few of the jewelry stores we passed had extra security, so we decided to go to <a class="bookmark" href="#theUniqueDiamond">The Unique Diamond</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Jelewry is not my thing, and to be honest I cared more about this crownsguard who decided to take notice of us. So I decided to stay outside and lean against a light post
				with the baby Manticore and keep an eye out. While standing there the crownsguardman busy's himself with a couple vendors across the street, picking items up
				and setting them back down. I try to talk to the baby Manticore but he gave very short responses and only talked about his desire to eat humans and raw meat. Lovely.</p>
			<p>I decided to walk over and see what this crownsguardman deal is. I approach the pottery table and grab a vase and ask the guard his thoughts. He takes a step away
				and leans away as though not wanting to be associated with me. I take a closer look at him and realize he's a Tiefling about 6 feet tall with blue horns and blue
				skin. He recommends the bowls and immediately moves over to the clothing booth. I set the vase down and walk over to the clothing booth and grab a poncho asking 
				his thoughts on the poncho. He looks at me and angrily says to follow him. He walks away and heads into a dark alley. I glance back and see Cornelius and Hee coming
				towards me from the jewelry store and indicate to them that I'm following him into the alley.</p>
			<p>He pushes me against the wall and says, <q class="quoteNPC">You need to stop noticing me.</q></p>
			<p><q class="quoteLyle">Why is that? You're not exactly being discrete</q>, I said coolly.</p> 
			<p><q class="quoteNPC">I've been sent to protect you, since you have decided to flaunt around a baby Manticore in a big city like a fool</q></p>
			<p><q class="quoteLyle">Who sent you to protect us?</q></p>
			<p><q class="quoteNPC">Who do you think? The Gentleman. He has a vested interest into your deal with him.</q></p>
			<p><q class="quoteLyle">Very well. We'll be on our way then.</q></p>
			<p>I walk out of the alley and inform Hee and Cornelius about our mysterious stalker. I asked them how their trip into the jewelry store went.</p>
			<p><q class="quoteCornelius">Lots of magical statues of women displaying jewelry. Jollied my jewels.</q> Cornelius said with a twinkle in his eye. 
				<q class="quoteCornelius"> Jeweler was an old man, pervert. Offered	Hee a 25% discount if he promoted his store. Fool spent 596gp on 600gp 
				worth of diamonds. But at least we have two more diamonds to revive people. I tried to see where he gets his diamonds from, he said
				<a class="bookmark" href="#theGrayingMountains">The Graying Mountains</a> from an orc named 
				<a class="bookmark" href="#gashnakhGorefang">Gashnakh Gorefang</a>. I'd like to get into contact with this guy the next time he visits Zadash. 
				He stays at the <a class="bookmark" href="#pillowTrove">Pillow Trove</a> and is expected to be there this week.</q></p>
			<p><q class="quoteLyle">Well, lets go check out this Pillow Trove so we know where it is.</q></p>
			<p>We walk into the <a class="bookmark" href="#triSpire">Tri-Spire district</a> only to realize that this is the rich part of town. Not a place
				some dirty travelers in common clothes would be found roaming around in. We arrived at the Pillow Trove to see a five story building made of 
				marble, two large doors in gold inlayed, and two guards standing by to open the doors as we walk through the entrance. Stair cases and chandeliers
				filled out view, with people dressed like they were going to some party or gathering. Cornelius noticed Hee's eyes glaze over at the sight
				of diamonds everywhere and quickly dragged him out of the building.</p>
			<p><q class="quoteLyle">May need to find a different way to be inside there without drawing so much attention.</q> I said with air of anxiety I 
				haven't quite felt before.</p>
			<p>We went back to the Innerstead Sprawl and went into <a class="bookmark" href="#theSongAndSupperInn">The Song and Supper Inn</a> to reserve the suite 
				and allow us all to remain in the same room. <span style="color: #808080">3sp</span> total with a cot on its way up. In the room itself, standard
				room with two beds, one large and one small, with a bookshelf of useless books and a table. A young lad brought the cot up and asked if we needed
				anything else. Cornelius requests raw meat from the butcher and the lad complies. Cornelius tips him handsomely making the kid drool instantly.</p>
			<p>I decided to send Yussa a message to see if anything new has come up and tell him about our recent discovery. <q class="toYussa">Killer found. Named 
				Thed. Going to find out what happened to make him do it. Any new information on your end?</q></p>
			<p><q class="fromYussa">The incantation on the ring was new, not old. Find out who put the incantation on the ring. Be very careful. Watch your back.</q></p>
			<p class="sessionEnds">We end the session sitting in the basement of <a href="../lyleLocations.html#theEveningNip">The Evening Nip</a> ready to depart for 
				our quest to Deastock.</p>
