		<h1>Lyle Goodbarrel</h1>
	
		<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Lyle Goodbarrel is a 20 year old Lightfoot Halfling whose hair and eyes are as brown as can be.</p>
			<p>Born and raised in a nomadic tribe, travelling the world for opportunity and adventure. The tribe had just recently 
				settled into the Copia Wildwoods located on the Continent of Wildemount along the Menagerie Coast.</p>
			<p>While he was out exploring the Copia Lake, Lyle heard some screaming in the distance that made him rush
				back to camp. But he was too late. His camp had been decimated and burned to the ground. Lyle spent
				the following days properly burying his family and mourning. In the process of cleaning up what used to be 
				his tribes camp he discovered a finger with a gold ring on it with a red gem. It contained an inscription:</p>
				<img src="images/deathToAll.png" alt="Draconic Inscription"/>
			<p>Lyle vowed to discover why his tribe was murdered. He vowed to find the person whose finger was left behind,
				and what meaning this ring had. This tragedy has caused him to no longer trust those around him, and prefers
				to stay hidden in case the people who killed his family find him. </p>
			<p>He left Copia Wildwoods and travelled to Tussoa to get supplies and a place to sleep before going to Port
				Damali. There he spent some time learning the ways of the <b>Rogue</b> and discovering that the ring
				is a <i>Ring of Fire Resistance</i> and the inscription reads:</p>
			<p><blockquote><strong><i>"Death To All"</i></strong></blockquote></p>
			<p>After gathering as much knowledge and skills from Port Damali as he could, Lyle followed down the Menagerie Coast
				stopping at place to place to hone his Rogue skills and gain whatever knowledge he can about the possible murderers.
				He arrives at Nicodranas where the story begins....</p>
