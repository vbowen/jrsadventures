		<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>Our group asked the older gentlemen who runs the <a class="bookmark" href="#feedAndMead">Feed and Mead Tavern and Inn</a>
				which businesses were still up and running in the city and we were told only three were not burned down.
				They were the <a class="bookmark" href="#broadBarn">Broad Barn</a>, <em>Stables</em>, and <a class="bookmark" href="#readyTopButchers">Ready Top Butchers</a>.</p>
			<p>Hee, having used his last diamond on the lady Cornelius killed, asks if there is a jeweller in the area that may be selling diamonds.
				The owner replies that <a class="bookmark" href="#Molly">Molly</a> is the only person who sells jewels.</p>
			<p>So the three of us leave and are calling for Molly in the part of town that was burnt down. Someone responds that her house is the 4th
				house at the end of the street. Now that Cornelius has a baby Manticore he is trying to figure out how to keep it at bay. He initially
				tries to tie it up, like a leash, but the baby Manticore fights back. We feed it some bacon and talk to it and tell it to behave. It
				agrees and we head down to talk with Molly.</p>
			<p>We find a lady staring at a burnt down house, and realize it is Molly. We ask her if she still has any jewels, specifically any diamonds,
				and she says everything is in the rubble and if we feel like searching for anything then we can keep half of it. We look at the burnt house
				and see it was a two story building that had been burnt down and now laid as a near one story house collapsed in. </p>
			<p>The three of us spent a few hours looking for jewels. Hee used Telekinesis to move debris while Cornelius and I used Prestidigitation to clean
				debris and look for what looks like jewel cases. Altogether we find 15 diamonds, 12 emeralds, 5 rubies, and 3 opals. We decide to keep just the
				diamonds and give back the rest.</p>
			<p>We leave Molly and head over to Ready Top Butchers to try and sell some Manticore meat. The <a class="bookmark" href="#butcherAlfield">Butcher</a>, 
				who had a bright red beard and red curly hair and blue eyes, didn't offer much, so we only sold 50 of 200 pounds for 1sp a pound.</p>
			<p>We then left to go to the general store. We walked in and realized quickly why it was called the Broad Barn. It was shaped and designed just like
				a barn with wooden floors and shelves. The counter in the center of the room allowed for customers to talk to the cashier from anywhere in the
				store. I asked the lady at the counter, a 5' woman with long blonde braided hair, if they would like to buy one of my Longbows. She wasn't sure so she
				went to go get <a class="bookmark" href="#george">George</a>, a dwarven man with a long beard, to see if they wanted to buy it. They were not interested.</p>
			<p>After we left the Broad Barn we decided to go see <a class="bookmark" href="#watchmasterBryce">Watchmaster Bryce</a> as he requested when we left the cave. When we got there, the watchmen were handing
				out supplies to the residence, giving the impression that they are all there to help each other. Bryce looked at the baby Manticore and asked us to 
				come to the back room for a quick discussion. He thanked us for helping the city and gave us 45 acres of land on the north side of town which contained
				a pond. He gave us the deed and it had the three of our names on it. He then said there was a man in Zadash named <a class="bookmark" href="#theGentleman">The Gentleman</a> 
				who may be interested in our Manticore and is the man who can provide any sort of help we may need in the city. He can be found at 
				<a class="bookmark" href="#theEveningNip">The Evening Nip</a>. Bryce said to order a drink and say <mark><em><q>While I have no coin, I'd be willing to offer many gifts.</q></em></mark></p>
			<p>We left the city and before we knew it were arrived in <a class="bookmark" href="#zadash">Zadash</a> where we were greeted with a bustling city with street vendors and
				carts and a town crier calling about three heroes who saved the city of Alfield. We ask a local guard who seemed off duty but still in uniform where we
				could find The Evening Nip. He said we can find it in the <a class="bookmark" href="#innersteadSprawl">Innerstead Sprawl.</a> We walk over there and see it's in a more
				middle class area. Zadash is also known as the Tri-Spires due to the 3 massive towers of which Innerstead Sprawl is directly in the middle. We see The 
				Evening Nip and go inside. It's small with wooden floors and booths with a bar which smells like stale beer. There's a low hanging chandelier and barstools 
				surrounding the bar top. There were not a lot of people in the room itself but there were two human male bouncers by the door, a human male at the bar sipping
				ale, and a dwarf behind the bar wiping down the bar top. <a class="bookmark" href="#bartenderEveningNip">The dwarf</a> had a disfigured face which looked as though it had been burned 
				and he was missing half his beard.</p>
			<p>We sit at the bar and and say to the dwarf <em><q>While I have no coin, I'd be willing to offer many gifts.</q></em> The bartender said to give him a moment and he went
				to the back. I heard some muttering behind me and when I turned around I could see a man in the corner rocking back and forth. He kept saying over and over "I didn't do it" and
				slamming his hands down on to the table. He seemed familiar for some reason and when I walked over to him I realized it was the half-orc who killed my family. He freaked
				out when he saw me and the bouncers came over to lead him out telling him to go home. The bouncers came up to me and asked me what my problem was with <a class="bookmark" href="#ted">Ted</a>. They 
				kept saying that Ted is the nicest person ever and that he never would have done anything. I told them that he killed my family and they scoffed at me.</p>
			<p>The bartender comes back and brings us back behind the bar. He gets pulled to the side by another guy to talk to privately before the dwarf returns and takes us 
				to a small storage room. He pulls a chain and a small trapdoor on the floor loosens up which he then pries open with a crowbar. We follow him down 40 feet below
				to a tavern.</p>
			<p>It was grandiose. An L shaped room with a balcony and beneath that balcony was a bar. Down over to our right was another balcony. All around us were dozens of people sitting
				and enjoying their drinks. Live music was being played. We were asked if we would like to sit at the table while we wait and we obliged. While sitting at our table we see another
				group sitting a ways away playing poker. A human male with brown eyes and blonde hair with a short moustache comes up and asks us what we would like to drink, assuring us
				that everything on the menu is free. While we waited for the waiter to bring our drinks we look around to see that every person in the room was wealthy. Not a place
				we would typically fit in to. The waiter comes back with our drinks in very heavy steins. Shortly thereafter The Gentleman arrives.</p>
			<p>He had a blue coat and leather gloves with a goatee and the sweatiest/oiliest skin I have ever seen. He asked me what my problem with Ted was, and I told him that I believe
				he was the one who killed my family. The Gentleman explains that Ted is not a dishonest person and that he has delved into thievery and odd jobs but was reliable and would never
				kill unless told to, which The Gentleman claims he has never done. He was sent on a job not too long ago and when he came back it was not the Ted who left. Now he just babbles
				on about dead bodies not his responsibility. The Gentleman then asks us to figure out what happened to Ted and he will give us his aid and give me the justice that I desire.</p>
			<p>Ted was in a town out to the West called <a class="bookmark" href="#deastock">Deastock</a> over the Tuscan Valley. Ted and his men did their job and he went out to the mountains.
				He went to a fortune teller there and did not come back the same. The Gentleman wants this fortune teller back alive or at the very least, the information he desires.</p>
			<p>After relaying this information we talked briefly about giving The Gentleman our baby Manticore and some parts from the mother Manticore and he said he would discuss it with his handler.
				Then, The Gentleman got up and left.</p>
			<p>After finishing the drinks The Gentleman provided us upon leaving, we departed the underground tavern and went to the <a class="bookmark" href="#butcherZadash">Butcher</a> shop to 
				sell our Manticore meat. The place was very busy. We walked up to the Half-Orc behind the counter and asked if he was interested in the Manticore meat. He grabbed the meat, 
				smelled it, and said he would pay 750sp (75gp).</p>
			<p>We left the butcher and went to the blacksmiths where we found a dwarven female hammering away at some metal. I sold my 7 longbows to her for 25gp each (175gp total) and bought a
				<a class="bookmark" href="#wristCrossbow">Wrist Crossbow</a> for 100gp.</p>
			<p class="sessionEnds">There we ended Session 16, anticipating our adventure to Deastock to capture and get information from the nefarious fortune teller. I need to send a message
				to Yussa to tell him about Ted and if he learned of anything new on the ring. Additionally, how can I get it back.....</p>
