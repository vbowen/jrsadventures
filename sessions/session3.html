		<h2>28 January 2023</h2>
		<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>We woke up the next morning and departed Yussa's castle to spend the day in Nicodranas at a few different stores.</p>
			<p>We ventured into <a class="bookmark" href="#theOpalArchway">The Opal Archway</a> to <a class="bookmark" href="#baronsBooks">Barons, Brews, &amp; Buns</a> 
				and looked for books that could help us learn about the region and the races who roam the area in hopes to gain insight in the killer of my family. 
				I purchased two books: <a class="bookmark" href="#draconiaBook">Draconia</a> and <a class="bookmark" href="#dwendalianBook">Dwendalian Empire</a>.</p>
			<p>Then we walked over to <a class="bookmark" href="#theOpenQuay">The Open Quay</a> to <a class="bookmark" href="#seaFloorsBounty">Sea Floors Bounty</a> 
				where we met <a class="bookmark" href="#deezma">Deezma</a>.</p>
			<p>After the general store we decided to head back up to The Opal Archway to check out <a class="bookmark" href="#beretosOils">Bereto's Oils &amp; Elixirs.</a>
				After talking with <a class="bookmark" href="beretos">Bereto</a> for a bit, we learned that his mom, <a class="bookmark" href="seretoBereto">Sereto Bereto</a>, lives in Zadash and teachs at
				the big school there. He explains that she loves pranks and left behind a chest that he swears has good stuff in it. I break into it for him only
				to discover it was full of clothing. I took a few <a class="bookmark" href="beretoOutfits">outfits</a> in anticipation I might need them later.
				Cornelius also decided to take a bunch of clothing (of which he sold later for some coin).</p>
			<p>We eventually made our way back to Yussa for him to fill us in with the remaining information we were looking for. He told us that Draconic incantations
				have not been used since the betrayer Gods during the calamity. Meant to be messages to their followers. Also used to control people. 
				Now Draconic incantation are outlawed. During calamity cities were attacked, not small places. This ring was worn by:</p>
			<img src="../images/half_orc.jpg" alt="Picture of Half-Orc" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"/>
			<p>He is a Half-Orc and is wearing clothing from Zadash. Yussa then requests to hold on to the ring to further analyze its history, to check if this
				inscription is old or new. Then he <a class="bookmark" href="orcQuest">requested</a> to capture the person to get more information from them. He then gave us a sending stone so we can
				communicate with him.</p>

						It has 7 uses. A creature with hair on their head may use the cream once a day to make themselves appear more cool and sexy, 
						giving them a +1 to any charisma checks or saves they have to make (the magical nature of the gel gives this bonus even when it's an 
						effect caused by a spell or a creature that doesn't find a head of perfectly styled hair sexy.) This takes 5 minutes and cannot be 
						done in combat (well it can but it's probably not the best use of your time). The effect lasts for one full day or until you take a 
						long rest. However, any time you take fire damage while using the cream, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the cream ignites and you take a 
						further 2d6 fire damage and have a -1 to all charisma checks and saves for the next d4+1 days while your hair regrows, and cannot use 
						the cream again until then. </td>

								you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or 
								fall prone and become poisoned until the end of their next turn. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn

						While you touch one stone, you can use an action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is the bearer of the other stone. 
						If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone and don't cast the spell. Once sending is cast 
						through the stones, they can't be used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical. <br />
						Sending - You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature holding the stone. The creature hears the message in its mind, 
						recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence 
						scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message. You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, 
						but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.</td>
