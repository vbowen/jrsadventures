						It has 7 uses <span class="sessionNum">(6 remaining).</span> A creature with hair on their head may use the cream once a day to make themselves appear more cool and sexy, 
						giving them a +1 to any charisma checks or saves they have to make (the magical nature of the gel gives this bonus even when it's an 
						effect caused by a spell or a creature that doesn't find a head of perfectly styled hair sexy.) This takes 5 minutes and cannot be 
						done in combat (well it can but it's probably not the best use of your time). The effect lasts for one full day or until you take a 
						long rest. However, any time you take fire damage while using the cream, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the cream ignites and you take a 
						further 2d6 fire damage and have a -1 to all charisma checks and saves for the next d4+1 days while your hair regrows, and cannot use 
						the cream again until then. </td>

						<ul> 
							<li>"Pour" produces enough ale to fill a pint.</li>

							<li>"Geyser" produces 30 gallons of ale that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action, while holding the decanter, 
								you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or 
								fall prone and become poisoned until the end of their next turn. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn 
								or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.</li>

					<td>Sending Stone: Sending stones come in pairs, with each smooth stone carved to match the other so the pairing is easily recognized. 
						While you touch one stone, you can use an action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is the bearer of the other stone. 
						If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone and don't cast the spell. Once sending is cast 
						through the stones, they can't be used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical. <br />
						Sending - You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature holding the stone. The creature hears the message in its mind, 
						recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence 
						scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message. You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, 
						but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.</td>
