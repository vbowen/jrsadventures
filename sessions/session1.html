		<h2>14 January 2023</h2>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>I spent the night outside... Camping. I hadn't quite made it into town yet, and I felt more comfortable hanging out in a large elm
				than I did walking into an unknown town in the dark. I woke up early and started walking into the Open Quay as the shops began opening.</p>
			<p>I saw a few signs for the <em><a class="link" href="#crosswandsInn">Crosswands Inn.</a></em>
				and began heading in that direction.</p>
			<p>Upon arriving to the Crosswands Inn, there was a sound of shock from behind the inn. A frantic sheep, actively looking around and runs
				to a Kobold sitting at a table outside the Inn. This Kobold was Hee, a PC played by Keith. He was about 2' tall with goldish blue eyes.
				The sheep runs up to him and drops a scroll out of its mouth and into his lap. It was a "Scroll of Speak With Animals". Hee reads the 
				scroll, and can now talk with the sheep.</p>	
			<p>On the other side of the patio area a Dwarf, fresh off the ship, arrives and sees what I'm seeing. This is Cornelius, a PC played by Ed.
				He's a 3 foot 91 year old mountain dwarf with red hair and a moderate beard. He was on his way to the inn to get supplies and relax 
				after a long journey.</p>
			<p>A <strong><em>BOOM!</em></strong> is heard and we look over to see a half-orc holding a black wolf with a silver collar in its hands.
				Standing next to him is a brown robed creature. The half-orc screams out that they want the sheep. He sets the wolf down and the wolf
				begins circling around the table that Hee is sitting at.</p>
			<p><mark>The Battle Begins!!!</mark> The three of us begin attacking the three culprits, Hee with a dagger and some ball bearings, Cornelius
				with his bow, and I with my shortbow. Hee creates a blinding light which causes the orc to stagger and make his face bleed. </p>
			<p>The brown robed creature pulls his hood back, and a big brown bear's head appears. The brown bear slips on the ball bearings and falls on his back
				while the Orc pulls out a great sword and smashes the table where Hee is hiding behind. The wolf runs with his tail between his leg, never
				to be seen again. The fighting goes back and forth with attacks and misses before Cornelius kills the brown bear with an Attack of Opportunity. 
				I sent the final blow to the orc in the back of his neck, bringing the battle to an end.</p>
			<p>The sheep heads over to Hee and tells him that his name is <em><a class="link" href="#Yussa">Yussa Errenis</a></em> and he used to live in a tower
				not too far from here but an evil wizard, his apprentice named <em><a class="link" href="#Noke">Noke</a></em>, turned him into a sheep. 
				Yussa says he needs his wand back in order to return back to himself.</p>
			<p>Cornelius and I join Hee and are told of the Sheeps backstory. Yussa talked about bodyguards being stationed at his tower and said the Wolf and 
				Bear were polymorphed guards while the Orc was loyal to his apprentice. The group follows the sheep out of town down a windy path towards the mountains.
				The group reaches a clearing and sees a tower that looks like a group of 4 oak tree stumps with 3 levels. 1st level is a tree stump with a platform.</p>
			<p>There are 3 guards located out of the front of the 1st level with 1 road up to the tower which leads to a grouping of roots creating a staircase to the 1st
				level. All the windows to the tower were boarded up so we decided to hide amongst the the trees until it became dark. A brown bear shoots a large d20 at some
				Apes and they have a small argument. We move to the northern portion of the trees and Cornelius pulls out his immovable rod and hoists me up to tie a rope
				allowing us to climb up to the platform.</p>
			<p class="sessionEnds">This marked the end of the first session. Sitting atop the first platform, wondering what are we getting ourselves in to, and what are
				we going to see when we get to the higher levels.</p>
