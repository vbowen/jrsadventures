		<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>Having reached the first level, Hee drops ball bearings at the entrance to the tree. Hee and I then go up the next set of stairs.
				Looking at the staircase and realizing it is open to the outside where the guards below might see us, I pull out my bedroll and lay
				it across the handrails to block Hee and my movements. We arrive to the door at the top of the stairs and listen for any noise. Since the stairs we are
				on were in the open air, stealth to not be heard by the guards below was essential. We pick the lock and push through the door to the 
				2nd level which is a living space with a library that has been put in complete disarray. We searched the area and get a few odd and end items such as
				a <a class="bookmark" href="#strangeMetalTin">strange metal tin</a>, <a class="bookmark" href="#arcaneKettle">kettle</a>, <a class="bookmark" href="#ballOfGravityDetection">ball</a>, 
				<a class="bookmark" href="#flaskOfEndlessAle">flask</a>, <a class="bookmark" href="#leRocShield">shield</a>, and <a class="bookmark" href="#bagOfBacon">bag</a>.</p>
			<p>Cornelius uses his immovable rod to block the door into the second tier from the first tier. We open the door to the walkway leading to the third floor
				and hear maniacal laughing through the third floor door. It was Noke. We begin our barrage of attacks and when Noke began getting weak he turned his bed into
				a dragon. During the battle, Hee gets injured, Noke loses concentration of the dragon and falls to his death next to the tree house. Cornelius retrieves 
				his immovable rod at the completion of the battle. Hee attempts to get from the third tier to the ground by using the sheepskin rug as a parachute but I stopped
				him and offer to build a "rope bridge" of sorts. While traversing the rope, Hee loses his grip and falls to the ground, taking additional damage. 
				We find the wand and give it back to Yussa, who turns himself back to his original form. Yussa then takes us back to his <a class="bookmark" href="#yussaTower">tower</a> explaining that 
				we can stay the night and he will clear things up with the towns' guard regarding the earlier fight. While at the tower, Yussa makes a magical 
				mansion where the players sleep for the night. </p>
			<p>Upon morning, we have breakfast while being given our reward items. I ask Yussa about my ring of fire resistance that has a draconic inscription in the gemstone. 
				Yussa takes the information given to him and asks that I return tomorrow so that he can have time to consult his tomes for information.</p>
			<p class="sessionEnds">This marked the end of the second session. We will need to kill some time tomorrow before going back to the tower to talk to Yussa and get
				more information on the ring.</p>

						There was a dining room down the hall with a large table with high top chairs. Around the room were paintings that seemed to paint the history and likeness of Nicodranas.</td>
